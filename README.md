# ❄️ Snowman Meltdown

A Hangman-style word guessing game written in Python. Guess the hidden word before the snowman melts away completely!

## How to Play

1. Run the game: `python snowman.py`
2. You'll be given a hidden word shown as blanks (`_`)
3. Guess one letter at a time
4. You have **6 wrong guesses** before the snowman melts
5. Reveal the full word to save the snowman ❄️

## Snowman Stages

The snowman melts through **7 stages** — from fully built to a puddle:

```
   _===_       →   (melting...)   →    ~~~~~~~
  (o   o)                             *  R.I.P  *
  ( > < )                              ~~~~~~~
```
